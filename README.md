## MyPromoter : An Upscale Connection Between Consumers & Nightlife ##

## Current Problems in Booking Tables at Nightlife Venues: ##
  1. Currently, promotors aggressively market their custom deals to potential clients.
  2. Foreigners don't like dealing with street promoters.
  3. There are little-to-no apps which are explicitly for Nightlife Entertainment scene.

## Current Scenario ##
  You know someone that works at/for the club.
  You text them the party size & budget.
  Depending on who's performing & table location, the more money the party spends, the better experience.

## Solution:
  1. Display the bottle service deals directly to users as they search by city name, club name, etc.
  2. Book directly on app.
  3. Allow promoters to signup with our app to offer their guestlist and bottle deals and promote events.
  4. Allow Users to Enter Email / Phone # to recieve deal alerts.
  5. Notify users who's location while using the app is within a 15 mile radius of clubs and events.
