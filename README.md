## MyPromoter : A Direct Connection Between Consumers & Nightlife Venues ##

## Current Problems in Booking Tables at Nightlife Venues: ##
  1. Currently, promotors aggressively market their custom deals to potential clients.
  2. Foreigners don't like dealing with street promoters.

## Current Scenario ##
  You know someone that works at/for the club.
  You text them the party size & budget.
  Depending on who's performing & table location, the more money the party spends, the better experience.

## Solution:
  1. Cut out the middle-man promoters.
  2. Display the bottle service deals directly to users as they search by city name, club name, etc.
  3. Book directly on app.
